Calculate the reflections of a particular crypto on a particular address. Typically only tokens give reflections, but we support performing the hypothetical calculation for any supported crypto.

Reflections are calculated by looking at the current balance, the net sum of all transactions, and the tax imposed on sending that crypto, which the user must supply. (Although project teams often advertise both a receive (or buy) tax and a send (or sell) tax, we only need the send tax to perform the calculation.)

Note that the expected reflections calculated may not match the actual amount of reflections earned. Some reasons for discrepancies:
--> The provided percentage information is incorrect.
--> There are too many transactions to analyze.
--> The smart contract for a token does not provide reflections as the project team advertised.
--> The smart contract has not used a constant tax percentage for sending tokens.
--> The smart contract uses a different tax for different kinds of transfers (e.g. 5% to send to another wallet, but 20% to sell).

Given this, any amount calculated should be treated as an estimate.
