When the app encounters a new token, it will attempt to add it to the database for you. However, if you wish to add a token yourself manually, you may do so here.

For example, if you wish to query the price of a token the app has never encountered before, you will need to add the token yourself here.

Be very careful to enter the correct information for your token to avoid errant calculations!
