Import app data from a file.
On newer devices, you can use a document browser to select a file to open.
On older devices, however, you are limited to a fixed set of folders specified by your device.

IMPORTANT - Data that is imported will overwrite any matching existing data.

For example, if you currently have 3 Transaction Portfolios named "A", "B", and "C",
and you import a Transaction Portfolio named "B", then "A" and "C" will remain untouched,
but "B" will be completely overwritten with the data that was taken from the file.
