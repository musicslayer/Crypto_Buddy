View transactions on a crypto address, and then get the net values of all assets involved, including a total USD value.

Buttons left to right:
--> Address information
--> Get net values*
--> Refresh table
--> QR Codes

*Note - this is the net sum of all transactions we have detected. This may NOT equal the current balance at that address.
For example, many smart contract operations (reflections, taxes, bridges, etc.) are not included.
