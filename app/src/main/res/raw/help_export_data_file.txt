Export app data to a file.
On newer devices, you can use a document browser to select a file to create or overwrite.
On older devices, however, you are limited to a fixed set of folders specified by your device.

Files in these device-specific folders can sometimes be accessed by mounting your device to a computer.
Otherwise, we recommend using the EMAIL option instead to make the data more easily available.

IMPORTANT - Any files in these device-specific folders may be erased if the app is uninstalled, unless you explicitly choose to keep app data.
