The app is hardcoded to recognize a list of fiats.
However if you wish to record a transaction for a different fiat, you may use the Fiat Manager to add it yourself.

Key:
Hardcoded Fiats - Fiats built into the app by the developer.
Found Fiats - Fiats seen while analyzing an exchange account.
Custom Fiats - Fiats the user manually added.

(x, y, z) -> x fiats hardcoded, y fiats found, and z custom fiats


There is a precedence ordering when fiats are in more than one category.
The app will recognize a hardcoded fiat first, then a found fiat, and lastly a custom fiat.
