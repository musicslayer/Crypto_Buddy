The app is hardcoded to recognize a list of coins. However if you wish to record a transaction for a different coin, you may use the Coin Manager to add it yourself.

Key:
Hardcoded Coins - Coins built into the app by the developer.
Found Coins* - Coins seen while analyzing an exchange account.
Custom Coins - Coins the user manually added.

(x, y, z) -> x coins hardcoded, y coins found, and z custom coins


There is a precedence ordering when coins are in more than one category. The app will recognize a hardcoded coin first, then a found coin, and lastly a custom coin.

*These are not currently used but may be used in a future update.
