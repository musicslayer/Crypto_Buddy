Export app data to a file in the shared/external storage folder.
This file can usually be accessed externally by mounting your device to a computer.
(If your device does not support that, we recommend using the EMAIL option instead to make the file available externally.)

IMPORTANT - If you want the file to persist if the app is uninstalled, you must choose to keep app data.
Otherwise all export files in the shared/external storage folder will be erased.
