Manage persistent app data here. This includes settings, assets stored in the app's database, and portfolios.

There are various methods of importing* and exporting* data:
--> Using a file on your device
--> Using the clipboard
--> Using email attachments (export only)

Individual types of data can be erased using "Delete Data". If you wish to completely wipe the app of all data, "Reset App" will make your app act like a new install.

Lastly, please note that the following items will not be exported or imported:
--> Hardcoded Fiats
--> Hardcoded Coins
--> Downloaded Tokens
