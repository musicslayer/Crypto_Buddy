Manage persistent app data here. This includes settings, assets stored in the app's database, and portfolios.

There are various methods of importing* and exporting* data:
--> Using a file on your device
--> Using the clipboard
--> Using email attachments (export only)

Please note that the following items will not be imported or exported:
--> Hardcoded Fiats
--> Hardcoded Coins
--> Downloaded Tokens

Individual types of data can be erased using "Delete Data". If you wish to completely wipe the app of all data, "Reset App" will make your app act like a new install.


IMPORTANT - Data that is imported will overwrite any matching existing data.

For example, if you currently have 3 Transaction Portfolios named "A", "B", and "C",
and you import a Transaction Portfolio named "B", then "A" and "C" will remain untouched,
but "B" will be completely overwritten with the data that was taken from the file.
