Enter any crypto address you wish to analyze for balance and transaction information.

If the address is valid on multiple networks (common for "Ethereum Format" 0x addresses), the app will ask you which network the address is meant for.

Addresses may be case sensitive, depending on the network.

With an in-app purchase, you may toggle whether you wish to look at just coins, or both coins and tokens.
If you do not care about tokens, choosing "Coins" may save time in analyzing the address.
