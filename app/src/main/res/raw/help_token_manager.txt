The app is hardcoded to recognize coins, and often will automatically recognize tokens as well.
However for some blockchain networks or particular tokens this is not possible.

You can use the Token Manager to download lists of tokens into the app's database.
If your token is newer and/or not officially recognized, you can also manually add a custom token yourself.

Key:
Downloaded Tokens - Tokens from lists downloaded from the internet.
Found Tokens - Tokens seen while analyzing a crypto address.
Custom Tokens - Tokens the user manually added.

For tokens that can be downloaded:
(x, y, z) -> x tokens downloaded, y tokens found, and z custom tokens

For tokens that cannot be downloaded*:
(y, z) -> y tokens found and z custom tokens


(*Some token types, such as Binance Smart Chain, have too many tokens to feasibly download and store a complete collection upfront.)
