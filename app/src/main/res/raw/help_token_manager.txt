The app will often automatically recognize tokens. However for some blockchain networks or particular tokens this is not possible.

You can use the Token Manager to download lists of tokens into the app's database. If your token is newer and/or not officially recognized, you can also manually add a custom token yourself.

Key:
--> Downloaded Tokens - Tokens from lists downloaded from the internet.
--> Found Tokens - Tokens seen while analyzing a crypto address or an exchange account.
--> Custom Tokens - Tokens the user manually added.

(x, y, z) -> x tokens downloaded*, y tokens found, and z custom tokens

(*Some token types, such as Binance Smart Chain, have too many tokens to feasibly download and store a complete collection upfront.)


There is a precedence ordering when tokens are in more than one category. The app will recognize a downloaded token first, then a found token, and lastly a custom token.
